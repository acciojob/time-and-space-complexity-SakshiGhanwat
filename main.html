  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
  <p>
    Time complexity refers to how the runtime of an algorithm changes with the size of the input. It helps us analyze whether an algorithm is efficient and scalable when processing larger datasets.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses while executing. It helps determine how efficiently an algorithm utilizes memory resources, often expressed using notations like O(n).
